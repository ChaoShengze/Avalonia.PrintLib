# AvaloniaUI.PrintToPDF

This is an experimental lib to create PDF documents from [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) visuals.

The PDF files are generated by the [Skia](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) PDF backend.

The demo app generates PDF files using some pages from the Avalonia Control Catalog.
Here is [a sample PDF file](https://github.com/Oaz/AvaloniaUI.PrintToPDF/raw/master/doc/sample.pdf)
